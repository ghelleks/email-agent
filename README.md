# Gmail Labeler ‚Äî Automated Email Triage with AI

An intelligent Google Apps Script that automatically organizes your Gmail inbox by analyzing emails with Google's Gemini AI and applying helpful labels. Perfect for busy professionals who want to stay on top of their email without manual sorting.

## What This Does

This system automatically reads your incoming Gmail and sorts it into four actionable categories:

- **`reply_needed`** ‚Äî Emails requiring your personal response (questions, meeting requests, urgent items)
- **`review`** ‚Äî Emails to read but no immediate response needed (updates, newsletters, FYI messages)
- **`todo`** ‚Äî Emails representing tasks or action items (assignments, deadlines, follow-ups)
- **`summarize`** ‚Äî Long emails or threads that benefit from AI summarization

**Example**: A meeting invitation gets labeled `reply_needed`, while a weekly newsletter gets labeled `review`.

## Quick Start Summary

**New to this?** Here's what you'll accomplish:

‚úÖ **Main Goal**: Set up automatic email labeling that runs in Google's cloud
‚úÖ **Time Required**: 5-10 minutes for basic setup
‚úÖ **Technical Level**: Beginner-friendly with step-by-step instructions
‚úÖ **What You'll Get**: Your Gmail automatically organized into 4 helpful categories

**Ready?** Follow the setup guide below. You can stop after the basic setup and add advanced features anytime.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **A Google account** with Gmail access (the account you want to organize)
- **Node.js 18 or higher** (we'll install this using Homebrew below)
- **Basic command line familiarity** (don't worry, we'll guide you through each step)
- **5-10 minutes** for initial setup

**No prior Google Apps Script experience required!** This guide assumes you're starting from scratch.

### Install Node.js using Homebrew

If you don't have Node.js installed, we'll use Homebrew (the best package manager for Mac):

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**Why use Homebrew?** It makes installing and updating development tools much easier than downloading individual installers. Homebrew manages dependencies and keeps everything organized.

## What is Google Apps Script?

Google Apps Script is Google's cloud-based JavaScript platform that lets you automate Google services like Gmail, Drive, and Sheets. Think of it as a way to create custom mini-programs that run in Google's cloud and can access your Google services automatically.

**Why use Apps Script for this project?**
- **No server needed**: Your script runs in Google's cloud, not on your computer
- **Built-in Gmail access**: No complex authentication setup required
- **Free to run**: Google provides generous free quotas for personal use
- **Automatic scheduling**: Can run on its own without your computer being on

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

First, install Google's command-line tool for managing Apps Script projects:

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
```

**Why this step is necessary**: `clasp` (Command Line Apps Script Projects) lets you work with Apps Script code locally on your computer and upload it to Google's servers.

Next, log in to your Google account:

```bash
clasp login --no-localhost
```

**Why this step is necessary**: This connects `clasp` to your Google account so it can create and manage Apps Script projects for you.

### Step 2: Get a Gemini API Key (One-time Setup)

The system uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze your emails. You need an API key to access it:

#### 2a. Create or Select a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click the project dropdown at the top (next to "Google Cloud")
3. Click "New Project" (or select an existing one if you prefer)
4. Enter a project name like "Gmail Labeler" ‚Üí Click "Create"
5. Wait for the project to be created (usually 10-30 seconds)

**Why this step is necessary**: Google Cloud projects organize your API usage and billing. Even though this is free, Google requires a project container.

#### 2b. Enable the Generative Language API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, use the search bar at the top
2. Type "Generative Language API" and click on it
3. Click the blue "Enable" button
4. Wait for it to enable (usually a few seconds)

**Why this step is necessary**: This gives your project permission to use Google's Gemini AI models.

#### 2c. Create an API Key

1. In the left sidebar, click "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click the blue "Create credentials" button ‚Üí "API key"
3. Copy the API key that appears (it looks like: `AIzaSyC-abc123def456...`)
4. **Important**: Store this key securely ‚Äî you'll need it in the next step

**Optional but recommended**: Click "Restrict key" to improve security, then select "Generative Language API" under "API restrictions".

### Step 3: Set Up the Apps Script Project

#### 3a. Download and Create the Project

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/download/email-agent
   ```
3. Create the Apps Script project:
   ```bash
   npm run create
   ```

**Why this step is necessary**: This creates a new Apps Script project in your Google account and links it to the code on your computer.

#### 3b. Upload the Code

Upload your code to Google's servers:

```bash
npm run push
```

**Why this step is necessary**: This copies your local code files to the Apps Script project in Google's cloud where they can run.

#### 3c. Open and Configure the Project

Open the Apps Script editor in your browser:

```bash
npm run open
```

This will open the Google Apps Script editor. You'll see your code files listed on the left.

### Step 4: Configure Your Settings

In the Apps Script editor, configure your project:

1. **Click "Project Settings" in the left sidebar**
2. **Scroll down to "Script properties"**
3. **Click "Add script property" and add these settings**:

   | Property Name | Value | Purpose |
   |---------------|-------|---------|
   | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your API key from Step 2 | Connects to Gemini AI |
   | `DRY_RUN` | `true` | Test mode (optional, recommended for first run) |
   | `DEBUG` | `true` | Verbose logging (optional, helpful for troubleshooting) |

**Why this step is necessary**: Script Properties are like settings that tell your script how to behave. They're stored securely in Google's cloud.

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

#### 5a. Authorize the Script

1. In the Apps Script editor, click on "Code.gs" in the file list
2. Make sure "run" is selected in the function dropdown at the top
3. Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
4. **You'll see authorization prompts** ‚Äî click "Review permissions"
5. Choose your Google account
6. Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to Gmail Labeler (unsafe)" ‚Üí "Allow"

**Why this step is necessary**: Google needs your permission to let the script access your Gmail. This is a one-time authorization.

**What you're authorizing**: The script to read your email, create labels, and modify labels on your emails.

#### 5b. Check the Results

1. Look at the "Execution log" at the bottom of the Apps Script editor
2. You should see messages like "No candidates" or "Processing X threads"
3. Check your Gmail ‚Äî you should see new labels created: `reply_needed`, `review`, `todo`, `summarize`

If you set `DRY_RUN=true`, the script will analyze emails but won't apply labels yet (recommended for testing).

## Understanding Your Results

After running the script:

- **`reply_needed`**: Check these emails first ‚Äî they need your response
- **`review`**: Read when you have time ‚Äî informational content
- **`todo`**: Action items and tasks to add to your task list
- **`summarize`**: Long emails that benefit from AI summarization

Each email gets exactly one label to keep things simple and clear.

## üéâ Congratulations!

You now have automated email labeling set up! Your Gmail will automatically organize new emails into helpful categories. You can run the script manually anytime by clicking "Run" in the Apps Script editor.

**Ready for more?** The following advanced features are completely optional. Each can be added independently:

## 2. Email Summarizer Agent

**What it adds**: Automatic daily summaries of emails labeled with `summarize`.

**Why you might want this**: Perfect for processing newsletters, long email threads, or multiple related emails into digestible summaries delivered to your inbox.

### How the Email Summarizer Works

The **Email Summarizer** is an intelligent agent that:

- **Archives immediately** when you apply the `summarize` label (configurable, enabled by default)
- **Retrieves** emails with the `summarize` label from the past 7 days
- **Generates** Economist-style summaries using AI
- **Delivers** formatted HTML summaries via email with hyperlinks and source references
- **Relabels** processed emails as `summarized` and archives them (if not already archived)
- **Runs** on configurable daily triggers (default: 5 AM)

This agent operates independently and requires no manual intervention once configured. By default, emails are archived immediately when you apply the `summarize` label, keeping your inbox clean while the scheduled summarization process finds them via the label.

### Email Summarizer Setup

**Prerequisites**: Complete the basic email labeling setup first.

1. **Install the summarizer trigger**:
   - In the Apps Script editor, select "installSummarizerTrigger" from the function dropdown
   - Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to install the daily trigger
   - The Email Summarizer will run daily at 5 AM

2. **Start using it**:
   - Apply the `summarize` label to emails in Gmail
   - Wait for the next daily run (or test manually by running `runSummarizerAgent` in the editor)
   - Receive summary emails in your inbox

### Email Summarizer Configuration

Customize the summarizer with these Script Properties:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `SUMMARIZER_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable the Email Summarizer agent |
| `SUMMARIZER_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | `7` | Maximum age of emails to include in summaries |
| `SUMMARIZER_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SUMMARY` | `50` | Maximum emails to process per summary |
| `SUMMARIZER_DESTINATION_EMAIL` | Your email | Email address to receive summaries |
| `SUMMARIZER_ARCHIVE_ON_LABEL` | `true` | Archive emails immediately when `summarize` label is applied |
| `SUMMARIZER_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable detailed logging for the agent |
| `SUMMARIZER_DRY_RUN` | `false` | Test mode for the agent |

### Email Summarizer Troubleshooting

## 4. Multi-Account Setup

**What it adds**: Manage multiple Gmail accounts (personal, work, etc.) from one codebase.

**Why you might want this**: Keep work and personal email processing separate while managing both from a single development environment.

### Prerequisites for Multi-Account

Beyond the basic prerequisites, you'll need:
- **Multiple Google accounts** with Gmail access
- **Apps Script projects** for each account (we'll help you create these)
- **Basic understanding** of Google Apps Script project IDs

### Step 1: Initial Multi-Account Configuration

#### 1a. Run the Account Setup Wizard

```bash
npm run setup:account
```

This interactive wizard will:
- Detect and offer to import your existing single-account setup
- Guide you through adding multiple accounts
- Create the `accounts.json` configuration file
- Set up account switching capabilities

#### 1b. Add Your Accounts

For each Gmail account you want to manage:

1. **Log into the Google account** in your browser
2. **Create a new Apps Script project** for that account:
   ```bash
   clasp login  # Login to the specific Google account
   clasp create --type standalone --title "Email Agent - [Account Name]" --rootDir ./src
   ```
3. **Note the Script ID** from the output (looks like: `1BxKMGtEE123abc456def789...`)
4. **Add to configuration** using the setup wizard

**Example Multi-Account Configuration:**
```json
{
  "defaultAccount": "personal",
  "accounts": {
    "personal": {
      "scriptId": "1BxKMGtEE123abc456def789...",
      "description": "Personal Gmail account"
    },
    "work": {
      "scriptId": "1CyLNHuFF456ghi789jkl012...",
      "description": "Work Gmail account"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Each Account

For each account in your configuration:

#### 2a. Authenticate and Create Project Files
```bash
# Authenticate each account
clasp --user personal login
clasp --user work login

# Create project files for all accounts
npm run switch:create-project-files

# Deploy to specific account (includes code upload + web app + triggers)
npm run deploy:personal
npm run deploy:work

# Open Apps Script editor for configuration
npm run open:personal  # Opens personal account
npm run open:work      # Opens work account
```

#### 2b. Configure Script Properties

In each account's Apps Script editor, add the same Script Properties as the single account setup:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for this account
- `DRY_RUN`: `true` (recommended for initial testing)
- `DEBUG`: `true` (helpful for troubleshooting)

**Important**: Each Google account can use the same Gemini API key, OR you can create separate API keys for better quota isolation.

### Step 3: Test Multi-Account Setup

#### 3a. Validate Configuration
```bash
npm run validate:accounts
```

This checks that all accounts are properly configured and accessible.

#### 3b. Test Each Account
```bash
# Test personal account
npm run deploy:personal
npm run open:personal  # Test manually in Apps Script editor

# Test work account
npm run deploy:work
npm run open:work      # Test manually in Apps Script editor
```

#### 3c. Check Account Status
```bash
npm run switch:status  # Shows all account statuses
npm run status:all     # Shows status for all configured accounts
```

### Step 4: Deploy to All Accounts

#### 4a. Deploy to Specific Account
```bash
npm run deploy:personal   # Complete deployment (code + web app + triggers)
npm run deploy:work       # Complete deployment (code + web app + triggers)
```

#### 4b. Deploy to All Accounts at Once
```bash
npm run deploy:all        # Deploys to ALL configured accounts with confirmation
```

### Multi-Account Daily Workflow

#### Account Status and Information
```bash
npm run switch:status      # Check all account statuses
npm run status:personal    # Check personal account status
npm run status:work        # Check work account status
```

#### Account-Specific Operations
```bash
# Deploy changes to specific account (includes push + web app + triggers)
npm run deploy:personal
npm run deploy:work

# View logs from specific account
npm run logs:personal
npm run logs:work
```

#### Bulk Operations
```bash
npm run status:all       # Check status of ALL accounts
npm run deploy:all       # Deploy to ALL accounts (with confirmation)
```

### Multi-Account Tips and Best Practices

#### üîí Security Considerations
- **API Keys**: Each account can use the same API key OR separate keys for quota isolation
- **Permissions**: Each Apps Script project has independent permissions
- **Access Control**: Use work Google accounts for work email, personal for personal

#### üöÄ Deployment Strategy
- **All changes**: Use `npm run deploy:[account]` for complete deployment (includes --force push to prevent skipping)
- **Production**: Use `npm run deploy:[account]` for stable releases with consistent web app URLs
- **Bulk Updates**: Use `npm run deploy:all` when updating core functionality across all accounts

#### üîß Troubleshooting Multi-Account
- **Wrong Account Active**: Check with `npm run switch:status`
- **Login Issues**: Each account needs separate `clasp login` authorization
- **Configuration Errors**: Run `npm run validate:accounts` to check setup

### Migrating from Single Account

If you already have a working single-account setup:

1. **Backup**: Your existing `.clasp.json` will be preserved
2. **Run Setup**: `npm run setup:account` will offer to import your current setup
3. **Add More Accounts**: Use the wizard to add additional accounts
4. **Gradual Migration**: You can use both old commands (`npm run deploy`) and new commands (`npm run deploy:personal`) simultaneously
5. **Switch When Ready**: Once comfortable, use multi-account commands exclusively

Your existing setup continues to work throughout the migration process.

## Understanding Your Results

After running the script:

- **`reply_needed`**: Check these emails first ‚Äî they need your response
- **`review`**: Read when you have time ‚Äî informational content
- **`todo`**: Action items and tasks to add to your task list
- **`summarize`**: Long emails that will be automatically processed by the Email Summarizer agent
- **`summarized`**: Emails that have been processed and summarized by the Email Summarizer agent

Each email gets exactly one label to keep things simple and clear.


### Customization (Advanced)

You can customize how emails are categorized by creating a rules document:

1. Create a new Google Doc with your classification rules
2. Get the document's URL (share link)
3. Add `RULE_DOC_URL` to your Script Properties with this URL

**Important**: If you configure a rules document, it must be accessible to the Apps Script project. The script will fail with a clear error message if the document cannot be read, rather than silently falling back to defaults.

The system includes sensible defaults, so this is completely optional.

## Useful Commands

Once set up, these commands help you manage your project:

**üîç Problem**: `clasp login` required for each account
- **Solution**: This is normal - each Google account needs separate authorization
- **Solution**: Run `clasp --user [account] login` and authorize each account you want to use

**üîç Problem**: Account-specific commands fail
- **Solution**: Run `npm run validate:accounts` to check configuration
- **Solution**: Ensure all Script IDs in `accounts.json` are valid
- **Solution**: Run `npm run switch:create-project-files` to recreate project files

### Getting Help

1. **Check the execution logs**: In Apps Script editor, look at the bottom panel after running
2. **Enable debug mode**: Set `DEBUG=true` in Script Properties for detailed logging
3. **Try dry run mode**: Set `DRY_RUN=true` to test without making changes
4. **For multi-account issues**: Run `npm run validate:accounts` to diagnose configuration problems

## Security Notes

- **Your API key**: Keep it private ‚Äî don't share it or commit it to code repositories
- **Permissions**: The script only accesses your Gmail to read emails and manage labels
- **Data**: Email content is sent to Google's Gemini AI for analysis but isn't stored permanently
- **Revoke access**: You can remove permissions anytime in your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

### Multi-Account Security
- **accounts.json**: Contains only Script IDs, not API keys or sensitive data
- **Separate permissions**: Each Apps Script project has independent access to its respective Gmail account
- **API key isolation**: Use separate API keys per account for quota isolation, or share one key across accounts
- **Account separation**: Work and personal email processing remain completely separate


## Configuration Reference

All settings are optional and have sensible defaults:

### Core Email Processing

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|

## Updating and Deploying the Script

### Understanding Deployment Types

There are two types of deployments in this system:

1. **Code Deployment**: Uploads your code to Apps Script (for automatic email labeling)
2. **Web App Deployment**: Makes the web dashboard accessible via URL

### Development Updates

For code changes during development:

```bash
npm run deploy:personal   # or deploy:work for specific account
```

This uploads code changes and maintains web app deployment consistency. The streamlined deployment includes the --force flag to prevent "skipping push" issues.

### Production Deployments

For significant updates (like model changes or new features), use the streamlined deployment workflow:

#### Complete Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:personal   # Deploy to personal account
npm run deploy:work       # Deploy to work account
npm run deploy:all        # Deploy to all accounts
```

Each deployment command:
1. Pushes code with --force flag to prevent "skipping push" issues
2. Creates a new versioned deployment
3. Maintains consistent web app URLs by redeploying to existing deployments
4. Automatically installs triggers
5. **Shows your web app URL immediately**
6. **Recommended for all production updates**

**Why use the streamlined deployment?** The new deployment script intelligently manages web app deployments to maintain consistent URLs while ensuring all components (code, web app, triggers) are properly updated together.

### Manual Version Control

You can also create versions manually:

```bash
npm run version:stable    # Creates a timestamped stable version
npm run version          # Creates a version with custom description
```

### Understanding Deployments vs Versions

- **Versions**: Snapshots of your code with descriptions (like git tags)
- **Deployments**: Published versions that can be shared or accessed via URL
- **Development**: Your working code that runs when you click "Run" in the editor

**Best Practice**: Use `npm run deploy:all` when updating your AI model or making significant changes to ensure everything works correctly together.

### When to Use Each Command

| Scenario | Command | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Any code changes or updates | `npm run deploy:[account]` | Complete deployment with consistent URLs |
| Deploy to all accounts | `npm run deploy:all` | Batch deployment across all configured accounts |
| Complete system setup or major updates | `npm run deploy:[account]` | Ensures all components updated together |
| Getting web app URL after setup | `npm run url:[account]` | Shows current web app URL and instructions |
| Testing new changes | `npm run deploy:[account]` in test mode | Safe development workflow with --force push |

### Example: Updating AI Model

When you update your AI model (like switching to a newer Gemini version):

1. Make your code changes locally
2. Deploy with `npm run deploy:[account]` which includes testing and production deployment
3. Verify the trigger is working with the new model using the web app URL provided

This ensures your scheduled runs use the updated model and maintains consistent web app URLs.

## Uninstalling

To completely remove the system:

1. **Remove automatic triggers**: Use the Apps Script UI (no trigger:delete command available)
2. **Clear settings**: Delete Script Properties in the Apps Script editor
3. **Remove labels**: Manually delete the Gmail labels if desired
4. **Revoke permissions**: Visit [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and remove access
