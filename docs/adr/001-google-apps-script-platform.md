# ADR-001: Google Apps Script Platform Choice

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-01-26
**Deciders**: Project team

## Context

The email-agent project needed a platform for automated email processing that could:
- Access Gmail API with minimal authentication complexity
- Run scheduled tasks automatically
- Integrate seamlessly with Google Workspace services
- Require minimal infrastructure setup and maintenance
- Handle email classification and processing workflows

The solution needed to be cost-effective, reliable, and easy to deploy for users already within the Google ecosystem.

## Decision

We chose Google Apps Script as the runtime platform for the email processing system.

The system is implemented as a Google Apps Script project that:
- Runs directly in Google's cloud infrastructure
- Uses built-in Gmail API access through GmailApp service
- Leverages time-driven triggers for scheduled execution
- Stores configuration in PropertiesService
- Integrates with Google Drive for rules documents

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Google Cloud Functions
- **Pros**: More flexible runtime, better performance, standard Node.js environment
- **Cons**: Requires complex OAuth setup, more infrastructure management, higher cost for small workloads
- **Why not chosen**: Authentication complexity and infrastructure overhead outweighed benefits for this use case

### Alternative 2: AWS Lambda + Gmail API
- **Pros**: Very flexible, powerful ecosystem, familiar serverless patterns
- **Cons**: Complex Gmail OAuth setup, requires external hosting, significant configuration overhead
- **Why not chosen**: Gmail integration complexity and additional infrastructure requirements

### Alternative 3: Standalone Node.js Application
- **Pros**: Full control, rich ecosystem, debugging flexibility
- **Cons**: Requires hosting infrastructure, complex OAuth flows, scheduling complexity
- **Why not chosen**: Too much operational overhead for the target use case

### Alternative 4: Browser Extension
- **Pros**: Rich user interface possibilities, direct browser integration
- **Cons**: Limited to manual triggering, complex deployment, browser-specific limitations
- **Why not chosen**: Cannot run automated scheduled processing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero infrastructure management**: No servers, deployment pipelines, or hosting costs
- **Seamless Gmail integration**: Built-in authentication and API access
- **Built-in scheduling**: Time-driven triggers handle automated execution
- **Easy user adoption**: Users can copy/deploy with minimal setup
- **Cost effective**: Free tier covers most usage patterns
- **Google Workspace integration**: Native access to Drive, Sheets, etc.

### Negative
- **Execution time limits**: 6-minute maximum execution time requires batch processing
- **Limited runtime environment**: Restricted JavaScript environment with limited libraries
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tied to Google's platform and service availability
- **Debugging limitations**: Limited debugging tools compared to local development
- **API rate limits**: Subject to Apps Script quotas and Gmail API limits

### Neutral
- **Development workflow**: Requires clasp CLI for version control and modern development practices
- **Language choice**: JavaScript/TypeScript only (acceptable for this project)
- **Deployment model**: Code runs in Google's infrastructure (appropriate for Gmail integration)

## Implementation Notes

- Use clasp CLI for local development and version control
- Implement batch processing to work within execution time limits
- Use PropertiesService for persistent configuration storage
- Structure code in multiple .gs files for better organization
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic for API calls
